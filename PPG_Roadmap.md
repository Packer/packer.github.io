## Roadmap
While an exactly roadmap is not in place, there are several key features that are already planned will be implemented.
### Minigame Modes
Right now minigames are all Free For All (FFA) as they are the easiest to create. In future updates you can expect to see modes such as below:
- Team Vs Team - 2 evenly matched teams minigames (2v2, 3v3, 4v4)
- Few Vs Many - A few players vs a majority team (2v3, 2v4, 2v5, 3v4, 3v5)
- 1 Vs Team - 1 Player takes on all other players
- COOP - All players work together to achive a goal

### Items
Items are already in development but are not quite ready. Some items include:
- +3 to Dice roll - Add 3 board moves to dice result
- -3 to Dice roll - Removes 3 board moves (Down to 0)
- Swap Spots - Randomly swaps position with another player

### Board Nodes
Each node will have a unique event that affects the game in different ways, some examples:
- Shop - Allows you to purchase items
- Boss - A special boss event specific to the board

### Boards
While the focus is on functionality intially, the game has been designed with expansion as a core feature. New boards will be possible going forward, the next planned board:
- Minigame World - A simplistic board that focusing on just playing the minigames
